# 🤖learningJava

A personal repository by [@rahules24](https://github.com/rahules24) to explore and reinforce core Java programming concepts through small projects and exercises.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as a learning sandbox for understanding Java fundamentals, covering:

- Basic syntax and structure
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Class and method design
- Compilation and execution of Java programs

It’s primarily for self-study, experimentation, and practice.

## 🧠 Projects Included

The repo contains multiple self-contained mini-projects:

### 📁 `Project1a`
Basic class structures and main method practice. Good for understanding:
- Entry point (`public static void main`)
- Java syntax essentials

### 📁 `Project1b`
Focuses on arithmetic operations and control structures. Includes:
- Command-line input
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops

### 📁 `sideProject1`
Miscellaneous experiments likely involving:
- Method overloading
- Simple object interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahules24/learningJava.git
   cd learningJava
   ```

2. Navigate into any project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Project1a
   ```

3. Compile and run using `javac` and `java`:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

> 💡 Ensure you have Java SDK installed and configured in your environment.

## ✅ Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A basic IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or simple text editors like VSCode

## 📌 Notes

This repository is an evolving collection of beginner-friendly projects. It may be updated sporadically as I explore more Java topics.
